The need for a central repository of recordings, photographs, and videos has risen in recent years to secure the messages, traditions, and virtuosity of dancers, musicians, and community leaders from across Ghana. In collaboration with the Agoo-Bi Nii Cultural Arts Center, the Ghana Music and Dance Archiving Initiative is aimed at amplifying individual voices-- giving credit where credit is due and respectfully showcasing their works for students, musicians, and researchers.

## About the Collection

This site is generated using [`collectionbuilder-gh`](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPEG images or PDF documents

The base site features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
